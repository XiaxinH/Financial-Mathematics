# Term Structure of Interest Rate

**Yield to maturity**: The internal rate of return which makes NPV as zero.

**Yield curve**: A graph of yield rates on investments, organized by the term of the investment.

**Spot rates**: The yield rate for a zero-coupon bonds with a given term to maturity. The interest rates in the next $t$ years, denoted by $s_t$. 

**Forward rates**: The interest rates of the future year $t$, denoted by $f_{t-1}$. 



$$f_0=s_1$$

$$(1+s_t)^t=(1+s_{t-1})^{t-1}f_{t-1}$$

$$P=\sum_{t}\frac{CF_t}{(1+s_t)^t}=\sum_{t}\frac{CF_t}{(1+i)^t}$$
