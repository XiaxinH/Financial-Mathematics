### Problem 1 {-}

To compare the two funds, we assume that equal investments of $X$ are made at time 0.

John's **accumulation function** is $$t^2+2t+1$$

Edna's **accumulation function** is $$2t^{2}+1$$

To determine when Edna's investment exceeds John's, we set:

$$ X(2t^{2}+1)>X(t^{2}+2t+1)$$

which reduces to:

$$t^{2}-2t>0$$ or $$t(t-2)>0$$

Thus, Edna's fund exceeds John's after 2 years.


### Problem 2 {-}

$$PV=1000v+2000v^{3}=2540.15 $$

since $$v=1.075^{-1}$$


### Problem 3 {-}

Discounting at $10\%$, the net present values are $4.59$,$-2.36$ and $-9.54$ for Projects A,B,and C respectively.

Take Project A as an example:

$$NPV=-800+500v+500v^{2}-175v^{3}+100v^{4}=4.59$$ 

since $$v=1.10^{-1}$$

Hence, only Project A should be funded.
