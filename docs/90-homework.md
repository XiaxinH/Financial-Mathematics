#### Weeks 7-8 {-#w7}

**Problem 1 (5/01 #37)**

Seth borrows $X$ for four years at an annual effective interest rate of $8\%$, to be repaid with equal payments at the end of each year. The outstanding loan balance at the end of the second year is $1076.82$ and at the end of the third year is $559.12$. Calculate the principal repaid in the first payment.


**Problem 2 (5/03 #39)**

A $30-year$ loan of $1000$ is repaid with payments at the end of each year. Each of the first ten payments equals the amount of interest due. Each of the next ten payments equals $150\%$ of the amount of interest due. Each of the last ten payments is $X$. The lender charges interest at an annual effective rate of $10\%$. Calculate $X$.


**Problem 3 (SOA SAMPLE/84 #15)**

A $\$30,000$ bank loan is to be repaid by $30$ annual installments of $\$1,000$ payable on the first day of each year beginning one year hence. In addition, interest at $4\%$ is payable on the last day of each year on the principal outstanding at the beginning of the year. At time of issue, the bank establishes a value $L$ for the loan, such that the yield rate is $5\%$ annually. Find $L$. 

#### Week 6 {- #w6}

**Problem 1 (SOA 11/00 #9)**

Victor invests $300$ into a bank account at the beginning of each year for $20$ years. The account pays
out interest at the end of every year at an annual effective interest rate of $i\%$. The interest is 
reinvested at an annual effective rate of $(\frac{i}{2})\%$. The yield rate on the entire investment over the $20$ year period is $8\%$ annual effective. Determine $i$.

**Problem 2 (SOA 5/03 #17)**

An association had a fund balance of $75$ on January $1$ and $60$ on December $31$. At the end of
every month during the year, the association deposited $10$ from membership fees. There were withdrawals
of $5$ on Februrary $28$, $25$ on June $30$, $80$ on October $15$, and $35$ on October $31$. Calculate
the dollar-weighted rate of return for the year.

**Problem 3 (SOA 11/00 #27)**

An investor deposits $50$ in an investment account on January $1$. The following summarizes the activity
in the account during the year :

|Date      |Value Immediately Before Deposit |Deposit |
|:---------|:--------------------------------|:-------|
|March 15  |40                               |20      |
|June 1    |80                               |80      |
|October 1 |175                              |75      |

On June $30$,the value of the account is $157.50$. On December $31$, the value of the account is $X$.
 Using the time-weighted method, the equivalent annual effective yield during the first $6$ months is
 equal to the (time-weighted) annual effective yield during the entire $1$-year period. Calculate $X$.

#### Week 5 {- #w5}

**Problem 1 (SOA 11/01 #16)**

Olga buys a $5$-year increasing annuity for $X$. Olga will receive $2$ at the end of the first month, $4$ at the end of the second month, and for each month thereafter the payment increases by $2$. The nominal interest rate is $9\%$ convertible quarterly. Calculate $X$.


**Problem 2 (SOA 5/95 #7)**

The first payment of a perpetuity-immediate is $60$. Subsequent payments decrease by $1$ per year until they reach a level of $k$. Payments remain constant at $k$ thereafter. The present value of the perpetuity is equal to the present of a perpetuity-immediate paying $44$ each year. The annual effective interest rate is $5\%$. Calculate $k$.

**Problem 3 (SOA 11/01 #5)**

Mike buys a perpetuity-immediate with varying annual payments. During the first $5$ years, the payment is constant and equal to $10$. Beginning in year $6$, the payments start to increase. For year $6$ and all future years, the current year‚Äôs payment is $K\%$ larger than the previous year‚Äôs payment. At an annual effective interest rate of $9.2\%$, the perpetuity has a present value of $167.50$. Calculate $K$, given $K < 9.2$.

#### Week 3 {- #w3}

**Problem 1 (SAMPLE/00 #27)**

Susan and Jeff each make deposits of $100$ at the end of each year for $40$ years.

Starting at the end of the $41st$ year, Susan makes annual withdrawals of $X$ for $15$ years and Jeff makes annual withdrawals of $Y$ for $15$ years. Both funds have a balance of $0$ after the last withdrawal.

Susan's fund earns an annual effective interest rate of $8\%$. Jeff's fund earns an annual effective interest rate at $10\%$.

Calculate $Y-X$.


**Problem 2 (SOA 11/01 #27)**

A man turns $40$ today and wishes to provide supplemental retirement income of $3000$ at the beginning of each month starting on his 65th birthday. Starting today, he makes monthly contributions of $X$ to a fund for $25$ years. 

The fund earns a nominal rate of $8\%$ compounded monthly. Each $1000$ will provide for $9.65$ income at the beginning of month starting on his 65th birthday until the end of his life.

Calculate $X$.

**Problem 3 (SOA 11/93 #4)**

At time $t=0$, Paul deposits $P$ into a fund crediting interest at an effective annual interest rate of $8\%$. At the end of each year in years $6$ through $20$, Paul withdraws an amount sufficient to purchase an annuity-due of $100$ per month for $10$ years at a nominal interest rate of $12\%$ compounded monthly. Immediately after the withdrawal at the end of year $20$, the fund value is zero.

Calculate $P$.

#### Week 2 {- #w2}

**Problem 1 (SOA 5/98 #2)**

John invests $1000$ in a fund which earns interest during the first year at a nominal rate of $K$ convertible quarterly. During the 2nd year the fund earns interest at a nominal discount rate of $K$ convertible quarterly. At the end of the 2nd year,the fund has accumulated to $1173.54$.

Calculate $K$.

**Problem 2 (SOA 5/89 #4)**

Two funds,$X$ and $Y$,start with the same amount.You are given:

1. Fund $X$ accumulates at a force of interest of 5\%.

2. Fund $Y$ accumulates at a rate of interest $j$, compounded semiannually.

3. At the end of eight years, Fund $X$ is $1.05$ times as large as Fund $Y$.

Calculate $j$.

**Problem 3 (SOA 11/89 #2)**

Fund $X$ starts with $1,000$ and accumulates with a force of interest $$\delta_{t}=\frac{1}{15-t} \text{ for } 0 \le t< 15.$$

Fund Y starts with $1,000$ and accumulates with an interest rate of 8% per annum compounded semiannually for the first three years and an effective interest rate of $i$ per annum thereafter.

Fund $X$ equals Fund $Y$ at the end of four years.

Calculate $i$.

#### Week 1 {- #w1}

**Problem 1 **

John invests $X$ in a fund growing in accordance with the accumulation function implied by the *amount function*
$$A(t)=4t^2+8t+4.$$
Edna invests $X$ in another fund growing in accordance with the accumulation function implied by the amount function $$A(t)=4t^2+2.$$
When does Edna's investment *exceed* John‚Äôs?

**Problem 2**

What deposit made today will provide for a payment of $\$1000$ in 1 year and $\$2000$ in 3 years, if the effective rate of interest is $7.5\%$?

**Problem 3**

Company $X$ received the approval to start no more than two projects in the current calendar year.
Three different projects were recommended, each of which requires an investment of 800 to be made at the beginning of the year.

The cash flows for each of the three projects are shown in Table \@ref(tab:week1):

Table: (\#tab:week1)The cash flows of the three projects.

| End of year| Project A| Project B| Project C|
|-----------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
|           1|       500|       500|       500|
|           2|       500|       300|       250|
|           3|      -175|      -175|      -175|
|           4|       100|       150|       200|
|           5|         0|       200|       200|

The company uses an annual effective interest rate of $10\%$ to discount its cash flows. 

Determine which combination of projects the company should select.
