### Problem 1 {-}

*SOA 5/98 #2*

John invests $1000$ in a fund which earns interest during the first year at a nominal rate of $K$ convertible quarterly. During the 2nd year the fund earns interest at a nominal discount rate of $K$ convertible quarterly. At the end of the 2nd year,the fund has accumulated to $1173.54$.

Calculate $K$.

### Problem 2{-}

*SOA 5/89 #4*

Two funds,$X$ and $Y$,start with the same amount.You are given:

1. Fund $X$ accumulates at a force of interest of 5\%.

2. Fund $Y$ accumulates at a rate of interest $j$, compounded semiannually.

3. At the end of eight years, Fund $X$ is $1.05$ times as large as Fund $Y$.

Calculate $j$.

###  Problem 3{-}

*SOA 11/89 #2*

Fund $X$ starts with $1,000$ and accumulates with a force of interest $$\delta_{t}=\frac{1}{15-t} \text{ for } 0 \le t< 15.$$

Fund Y starts with $1,000$ and accumulates with an interest rate of 8% per annum compounded semiannually for the first three years and an effective interest rate of $i$ per annum thereafter.

Fund $X$ equals Fund $Y$ at the end of four years.

Calculate $i$.

### Problem 1 {-}

John invests $X$ in a fund growing in accordance with the accumulation function implied by the *amount function*
$$A(t)=4t^2+8t+4.$$
Edna invests $X$ in another fund growing in accordance with the accumulation function implied by the amount function $$A(t)=4t^2+2.$$
When does Edna's investment *exceed* Johnâ€™s?

### Problem 2 {-}

What deposit made today will provide for a payment of $\$1000$ in 1 year and $\$2000$ in 3 years, if the effective rate of interest is $7.5\%$?

### Problem 3 {-}

Company $X$ received the approval to start no more than two projects in the current calendar year.
Three different projects were recommended, each of which requires an investment of 800 to be made at the beginning of the year.

The cash flows for each of the three projects are shown in Table \@ref(tab:week1):

Table: (\#tab:week1)The cash flows of the three projects.

| End of year| Project A| Project B| Project C|
|-----------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
|           1|       500|       500|       500|
|           2|       500|       300|       250|
|           3|      -175|      -175|      -175|
|           4|       100|       150|       200|
|           5|         0|       200|       200|

The company uses an annual effective interest rate of $10\%$ to discount its cash flows. 

Determine which combination of projects the company should select.
