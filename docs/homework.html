The 1-year spot rate is <span class="math inline">\(3\%\)</span> and the two-year spot rate is <span class="math inline">\(4\%\)</span>. Under the loan, the interest rate resets annually to the 1-year spot rate. Ryan entered into a 2-year interest rate swap to pay the fixed interest rate and receive the variable rate.

The 1-year spot rate is <span class="math inline">\(3.5\%\)</span> and the 2-year spot rate is <span class="math inline">\(4\%\)</span>. Sue decided to enter into a 2-year interest rate swap under which she will swap the variable interest rate for a fixed interest rate with annual settlement periods and a notional amount of <span class="math inline">\(\$20,000\)</span>. The variable rate is the 1-year spot interest rate at the beginning of the settlement period.
