Amortization schedule A table which shows the interrelationships between the balance, principal payments, and interest payments over the life of a loan. Sinking fund approach Repay the interest due and the principal separately (the loan amount does not change over the life of the loan): the interest due is repaid regularly during the loan period; the principal is repaid at the end of the loan period by a sinking fund. A fund designed to accumulate a specified amount of money in a specified time by making regular deposits is called a sinking fund.
