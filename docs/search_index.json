flow）按筹资利率\\(i_1\\)（financing cost）贴现到零时刻的现值为\\(P_0(i_1)\\)，计投资人现金流入（positive cash flow）按再投资利率\\(i_2\\)累积到\\(T\\)时刻为\\(S_T(i_2)\\)。修正内部收益率（MIRR）可通过求解方程\\(NPV=-P_0(i_1)+S_T(i_2)\\times(1+MIRR)^{-T}=0\\)求得。见书例4-15。 如果筹资利率\\(i_1\\)未给定，可对现金流出按修正内部收益率（MIRR）贴现。修正内部收益率（MIRR）可通过求解方程\\(NPV=-P_0(MIRR)+S_T(i_2)\\times(1+MIRR)^{-T}=0\\)求得，其中\\(P_0(MIRR)\\)表示现金流出的现值为MIRR的函数。见ppt中victor例子。 👉 期末中文考题 (2020/09/26) 👉 证明\\(\\frac{1}{a_{\\overline{n}\\mid}}=\\frac{1}{s_{\\overline{n}\\mid}}+i\\) (2020/09/24) 假设有A, B, C三种年金： A：\\(n\\)年期期末付等额年金，一共\\(n\\)个\\(\\frac{1}{a_{\\overline{n}\\mid}}\\)，分别在\\(t=1,\\ldots,n\\)。A的现值为\\[\\frac{1}{a_{\\overline{n}\\mid}} a_{\\overline{n}\\mid}=1\\] B：\\(n\\)年期期末付年金，一共\\(n-1\\)个\\(i\\)和一个\\(1+i\\), 分别在\\(t=1,\\ldots,n\\)。 B的现值为\\[ia_{\\overline{n}\\mid}+v^n=1.\\] C：C为B的“平滑”化年金，即把在时间\\(t=n\\)的1转化为\\(n\\)个在\\(t=1,\\ldots,n\\)的等额年金（其在\\(t=n\\)的累计值应为1），所以分摊到每个时刻的金额为\\(\\frac{1}{s_{\\overline{n}\\mid}}\\)。 “平滑”后的年金为\\(n\\)年期期末付等额年金，一共\\(n\\)个\\(\\frac{1}{s_{\\overline{n}\\mid}}+i\\)。 C和B的现值相同都为1。 可见，A和C同为\\(n\\)年期期末付等额年金，其现值都为1。所以，它们每期的金额也应该相同： \\[\\frac{1}{a_{\\overline{n}\\mid}}=\\frac{1}{s_{\\overline{n}\\mid}}+i.\\] 👉 \\(i\\) 和 \\(d\\) 的关系 （2020/09/16） 很多同学问课件上的这道题目。 问题：已知年实际利率为5%。回答下述问题： （1）100万元贷款在年末的利息是多少？\\(100\\times5%\\) （2）如果在贷款起始日收取利息，应该收取多少利息？\\(100\\times i/(1+i)=100\\times d\\) （3）年实际贴现率是多少？\\(d=i/(1+i)\\) \\(i\\) 和 \\(d\\) 的区别可以理解为 \\(i\\) 是在期末付，\\(d\\) 是在期初付。\\(d=i\\times v\\)，即期末 \\(i\\) 的现值是 \\(d\\)。 所以（1）是期末收的利息，（2）是期初收的利息。期初收的利息要比期末收的少，因为银行收到的这部分利息在这一年中还能产生利息，期初收的 \\(d\\) 到期末是 \\(i\\)。 贴现率 \\(d\\) 的另一种理解就是利息 \\(i\\) 的现值。 👉 计算器 （2020/09/10） 在课堂测验和期末考试，没有对计算器的严格要求，但至少需要科学计算器。大家不需要购买昂贵的可编程计算器，在这门课中，体现不出可编程计算器的优势。 建议的计算器是SOA/CAS要求的计算器。 👉 最终成绩 （2020/09/10） 平时成绩占40%，期末成绩占60%。 平时成绩主要根据课堂点名、课外作业的完成态度、随堂测试的准确度评定。 "],["interest-rate.html",

Amortization schedule A table which shows the interrelationships between the balance, principal payments, and interest payments over the life of a loan. Sinking fund approach Repay the interest due and the principal separately (the loan amount does not change over the life of the loan): the interest due is repaid regularly during the loan period; the principal is repaid at the end of the loan period by a sinking fund. A fund designed to accumulate a specified amount of money in a specified time by making regular deposits is called a sinking fund. Equal principal repayments Each repayments (decreasing repayments) involves (1) the level amounts of principal and (2) the interest on the outstanding balance.

The latest call date should be assumed: \\[P=4,000a_{\\overline{30}\\mid}+100,000v^{30}\\quad at\\quad i=5\\%\\] \\[P=84,627.55\\] Problem 3 The purchaser receives a total of \\(40s_{\\overline{40}\\mid{0.03}}+1000=4016.05\\) at the end of \\(20\\) years. The investment was \\(1014\\), so if \\(i\\) is the effective annual rate, we have \\(1014(1+i)^{20}=4016.05\\). \\[i=7.12\\%\\] Weeks 7-8 Problem 1 \\[B_3=Ra_{\\overline{1}\\mid}=\\frac{R}{1.08}=559.12\\] \\[R=603.8496\\] \\[P_1=603.8496v^{4-1+1}=443.85\\] Problem 2 At the end of \\(10\\) years, the loan balance is still \\(1000\\), since only the interest of \\(100\\) has been paid each year. Thereafter, \\(150\\%\\) of the interest due is paid, which means that the loan balance is reduced by \\(5\\%\\) each year.(Interest due\\(=1.5\\times10\\%\\times\\)loan balance end of previous year\\(=15\\%\\) of loan balance, of which \\(10\\%\\) is the interest due.) Thus, at the end of \\(20\\) years, the loan balance is \\(1000(1-0.05)^{10}=598.74\\). The next \\(10\\) payments are \\(X\\), so \\[Xa_{\\overline{10}\\mid{0.10}}=598.74\\] \\[X=97.44\\] Problem 3 The loan payments are \\(\\frac{30,000}{30}=1,000\\) toward principal plus \\(4\\%\\times30,000=1,200\\) in interest in year 1, \\(4\\%\\times29,000=1,160\\) in year 2, etc. The loan value \\(L\\) is the PV of these payments at \\(5\\%\\): \\[L=1,000a_{\\overline{30}\\mid}+40(Da)_{\\overline{30}\\mid}=15,372+40(\\frac{30-15.3724}{0.05})=15,372+11,702=27,074\\] Problem 4 \\[L = 1000{a}_{\\overline{10}\\mid{i}}\\] Total interest = sum of the payments minus amount of loan, thus \\[(10)(1000)-1000{a}_{\\overline{10}\\mid{i}} = 1000{a}_{\\overline{10}\\mid{i}}\\] \\[{a}_{\\overline{10}\\mid{i}} = 5\\] \\[i = 15.1\\%\\] Interest in first year = \\(1000(1-v^{10}) = 754.95\\) Problem 5 The principal repaid in year \\(3\\) can be expressed as the decrease in the loan balance in that year,i.e.: \\[P_3=B_2-B_3=100\\left[({Da})_{\\overline{8}\\mid{}}-({Da})_{\\overline{7}\\mid{}}\\right]=600\\] \\[{(Da)}_{\\overline{8}\\mid{}}-{(Da)}_{\\overline{7}\\mid{}}={a}_{\\overline{8}\\mid{}}\\] So, \\[{a}_{\\overline{8}\\mid{}}=6\\] \\[i=6.876426\\%\\] \\[L=100{(Da)}_{\\overline{10}\\mid{}}=100\\left(\\frac{10-{a}_{\\overline{10}\\mid{}}}{i}\\right)=4270\\] Week 6 Problem 1 \\[300\\ddot{s}_{\\overline{20}\\mid{0.08}}=(20)(300)+300i(Is)_{\\overline{20}\\mid{i/2}}\\] \\[14826.88=6000+300i\\left(\\frac{{s}_{\\overline{21}\\mid{i/2}}-21}{i/2} \\right)\\] \\[14826.88=6000+600{s}_{\\overline{21}\\mid{i/2}}-12600\\] \\[{s}_{\\overline{21}\\mid{i/2}}=35.711467\\] \\[i/2=0.05\\] \\[i=0.10\\] Problem 2 Total deposits = \\(120\\), total withdrawls = \\(145\\), investment income = \\(60+145-120-75\\) = \\(10\\) Thus, Dollar-weighted rate \\[=\\frac{10}{75+\\left(\\frac{1}{12}+\\cdots+\\frac{11}{12}\\right)(10)-\\left(\\frac{10}{12}\\right)(5) -\\left(\\frac{6}{12}\\right)(25)-\\left(\\frac{2.5}{12}\\right)(80)-\\left(\\frac{2}{12}\\right)(35)}\\] \\[=\\frac{10}{90.83}=11\\%\\] Problem 3 6-month yield: \\(\\left(\\frac{40}{50}\\right)\\left(\\frac{80}{60}\\right)\\left(\\frac{157.50}{160}\\right)=1+j=1.05\\). Effective annual yield = \\(1.05^2-1\\) = \\(10.25\\%\\). 1-year yield: \\(\\left(\\frac{40}{50}\\right)\\left(\\frac{80}{60}\\right)\\left(\\frac{175}{160}\\right)\\left(\\frac{X}{250}\\right)=1.1025\\). \\[X=\\frac{1.1025}{0.004667}=236.25\\] Week 5 Problem 1 Since there are monthly payments for \\(5\\) years, there are \\(60\\) payments: \\[X=2(Ia)_{\\overline{60}\\mid{j}}\\] Since the nominal rate is \\(9\\%\\) convertible quarterly,the effective rate for a \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) year period is \\(2.25\\%\\), and \\(j\\) can be determined from: \\[(1+j)^3=1.0225\\] \\[j=0.7444\\%\\] \\[2(Ia)_{\\overline{60}\\mid{j}}=2\\left(\\frac{\\ddot{a}_{\\overline{60}\\mid{j}}-60v^{60}}{0.007444} \\right)\\] \\[2(Ia)_{\\overline{60}\\mid{j}}=2\\left(\\frac{48.6077-38.4490}{0.007444} \\right)=2729\\] Problem 2 The perpetuity can be viewed as decreasing annuity with payments of \\((60-k)\\), \\((59-k)\\), \\(\\cdots\\), 1 plus a perpetuity with payments of \\(k\\) each year.(The sums of the payments under the decreasing annuity and the perpetuity are \\(60\\),\\(59\\),\\(\\cdots\\),\\(k+1\\),\\(k\\),\\(k\\),\\(k\\),\\(\\cdots\\),which are the same as the payments under the given annuity.) \\[PV=(Da)_{\\overline{60-k}\\mid{}}+\\frac{k}{i}\\] \\[PV=\\frac{(60-k)-a_{\\overline{60-k}\\mid{}}}{0.05}+\\frac{k}{0.05}=\\frac{44}{0.05}\\] \\[a_{\\overline{60-k}\\mid{0.05}}=16, 60-k=33\\] \\[k=27\\] Problem 3 Let \\(k\\) = \\(\\frac{K}{100}\\), \\[PV=10{a}_{\\overline{5}\\mid{}}+10v^{5}\\left(\\frac{1+k}{1.092}+\\left(\\frac{1+k}{1.092}\\right)^{2}+\\cdots\\right)\\] \\[=38.7+\\frac{(6.44)(1+k)}{0.092-k}=167.50\\] \\[k=0.04\\] \\[K=100k=4.0\\] Week 3 Problem 1 The most convenient comparison date is the end of the 40th year. For Susan: \\[100s_{\\overline{40}\\mid}=Xa_{\\overline{15}\\mid}\\] at \\(8\\%\\) \\[X=3026.55\\] For Jeff: \\[100s_{\\overline{40}\\mid}=Ya_{\\overline{15}\\mid}\\] at \\(10\\%\\) \\[Y=5818.93\\] \\[Y-X=2792.38\\] Problem 2 Amount to be paid at age \\(65\\) to guarantee a monthly life income of \\(\\$3000\\) is \\[3000\\times\\frac{\\$1000}{9.65}\\] \\(AV\\) of contributions at age \\(65\\) is \\(X\\ddot s_{\\overline{300}\\mid}\\) at \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\%\\) Namely, \\[X=\\frac{(3000)\\frac{\\$1000}{9.65}}{\\ddot s_{\\overline{300}\\mid}}=324.72\\] Problem 3 Paul withdraws \\(100\\ddot a_{\\overline{120}\\mid 0.01}=7039.76\\) at the end of years \\(6\\) to \\(20\\). \\(P\\) is the \\(PV\\) of these withdrawals at \\(8\\%\\) \\[P=7039.76v^5a_{\\overline{15}\\mid}=41009.68\\] Week 2 Problem 1 AV in 2 years = 1173.54, so we set: \\[1173.54=1000\\left(1+\\frac{K}{4}\\right)^{4}\\left(1-\\frac{K}{4}\\right)^{-4}=1000\\left(\\frac{4+K}{4-K}\\right)^{4}\\] Thus, \\[\\frac{4+K}{4-K}=1.17354^{1/4}=1.0408\\] Solving for K, we get: \\[K=0.08\\] Problem 2 AV in 8 years: Fund X:\\[e^{(0.05)(8)}=e^{0.4}\\] Fund Y:\\[\\left(1+\\frac{j}{2}\\right)^{(2)(8)}=\\left(1+\\frac{j}{2}\\right)^{16}\\] At the end of eight years, Fund \\(X\\) is 1.05 times as large as Fund \\(Y\\), so we set: \\[e^{0.4}=1.05\\left(1+\\frac{j}{2}\\right)^{16}\\] Thus, \\[j=2\\left[\\left(\\frac{e^{0.4}}{1.05}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{16}}-1\\right]=0.044\\] Problem 3 Fund \\(X\\) equals Fund \\(Y\\) at the end of four years, so we set: \\[1000(1.04)^{6}(1+i)=1000e^{\\int_{0}^{4} \\frac{1}{(15-t)} dt}\\] Then, \\[1000e^{\\int_{0}^{4} \\frac{1}{(15-t)} dt}=1000e^{-\\ln(15-t)|_{0}^{4}}=1000\\left(\\frac{15}{11}\\right)\\] Thus, \\[(1+i)=\\frac{15}{(11)(1.04)^6}=1.0777\\] \\[i=0.0777\\] Week 1 Problem 1 To compare the two funds, we assume that equal investments of \\(X\\) are made at time 0. John’s accumulation function is \\[t^2+2t+1\\] Edna’s accumulation function is \\[2t^{2}+1\\] To determine when Edna’s investment exceeds John’s, we set: \\[ X(2t^{2}+1)&gt;X(t^{2}+2t+1)\\] which reduces to: \\[t^{2}-2t&gt;0\\] or \\[t(t-2)&gt;0\\] Thus, Edna’s fund exceeds John’s after 2 years. Problem 2 \\[PV=1000v+2000v^{3}=2540.15 \\] since \\[v=1.075^{-1}\\] Problem 3 Discounting at \\(10\\%\\), the net present values are \\(4.59\\),\\(-2.36\\) and \\(-9.54\\) for Projects A,B,and C respectively. Take Project A as an example: \\[NPV=-800+500v+500v^{2}-175v^{3}+100v^{4}=4.59\\] since \\[v=1.10^{-1}\\] Hence, only Project A should be funded. "]]
