During the 2nd year the fund earns interest at a nominal discount rate of \\(K\\) convertible quarterly. At the end of the 2nd year,the fund has accumulated to \\(1173.54\\). Calculate \\(K\\). Problem 2 SOA 5/89 #4 Two funds,\\(X\\) and \\(Y\\),start with the same amount.You are given: Fund \\(X\\) accumulates at a force of interest of 5%. Fund \\(Y\\) accumulates at a rate of interest \\(j\\), compounded semiannually. At the end of eight years, Fund \\(X\\) is \\(1.05\\) times as large as Fund \\(Y\\). Calculate \\(j\\).

Problem 2 What deposit made today will provide for a payment of \\(\\$1000\\) in 1 year and \\(\\$2000\\) in 3 years, if the effective rate of interest is \\(7.5\\%\\)? Problem 3 Company \\(X\\) received the approval to start no more than two projects in the current calendar year. Three different projects were recommended, each of which requires an investment of 800 to be made at the beginning of the year. The cash flows for each of the three projects are shown in Table 2.1: Table 2.1: The cash flows of the three projects. End of year Project A Project B Project C 1 500 500 500 2 500 300 250 3 -175 -175 -175 4 100 150 200 5 0 200 200 The company uses an annual effective interest rate of \\(10\\%\\) to discount its cash flows.

["solutions-to-homework.html", "Solutions to homework Week 1", " Solutions to homework Week 1 Problem 1 To compare the two funds, we assume that equal investments of \\(X\\) are made at time 0. John’s accumulation function is \\[t^2+2t+1\\] Edna’s accumulation function is \\[2t^{2}+1\\] To determine when Edna’s investment exceeds John’s, we set: \\[ X(2t^{2}+1)&gt;X(t^{2}+2t+1)\\] which reduces to: \\[t^{2}-2t&gt;0\\] or \\[t(t-2)&gt;0\\] Thus, Edna’s fund exceeds John’s after 2 years.
