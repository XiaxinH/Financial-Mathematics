# Yield rates

**Net present value (NPV)** The present value of the cash inflows minus the present value of the cash outflows.

**Yield rates or internal rates of return (IRR)** The interest rate which makes the NPV zero.

**Uniqueness of the yield rate** Conditions for the uniqueness. Rule 1: The swift from cash outflows to cash inflows occurs only once; Rule 2: The sign of accumulated value under the IRR changes only once.

**NPV v.s. IRR** Sometimes NPV is preferred. See <https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/irrvsnpvcapitalbudgeting.asp>

**Reinvestment rates**

**Dollar-weighted interest rate** Appropriate for evaluating the performance of an investor.

**Time-weighted interest rate** Appropriate for evaluating the underlying performance of a fund

**Portfolio method** All get the same yield rate no matter when they began to invest.

**Investment year method**  Interest is credited in a way that recognizes the joining time to a fund.
